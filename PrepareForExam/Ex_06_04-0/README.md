Write a program that fills a square matrix `N x N` in a clockwise spiral starting from the upper left corner with numbers from `1` to `N^2`. The order of the matrix N is specified on the standard input stream-stdin as a positive nonzero number. Output the resulting matrix to the standard output stream-stdout as a table (after each outputted line of the resulting matrix, a line break must be performed), the elements must be separated by spaces, and there must be no space characters before the newlines. There should be no newline break at the end of the response. Check the validity of the entered data. In case of any error, output "n/a".
