Create a program that outputs elements of the `X = (X_1, X_2, X_3, ..., X_n)` sequence in the following order: `X_1 X_n X_2 X_{n-1} ...`. The `X` sequence consists of non-negative integers and is specified in the standard input streamâ€“stdin; the elements of the sequence are separated by spaces; the end of the sequence is -1, which marks the end of the sequence and is not one of its elements. There should be no newline break at the end of the response. Check the validity of the entered data. In case of any error, output "n/a".

> **Note:** There must not be a space after the last displayed element.

> There can be any size of the sequence
